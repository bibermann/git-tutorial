### Review strategies

#### Preparing a PR/MR

Before sending a pull/merge request, please make sure
that your commit messages are well-formed and adjust them if necessary.
See the previous chapter on how to write commit messages.
You may need to squash some of your commits into single ones.
Generally you should *not* try to think about the possibly known person
who will eventually review your request,
but about a new developer in your team trying to understand
what you have done and why.
He will go through your changes commit by commit
so provide him a concise but comprehensible journey through your work.
